1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,534
(dark dramatic music)

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,087
(crickets chirp)

3
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:18,087
(footsteps shuffle)

4
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,090
- I don't know. This isn't
such a good idea, guys.

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,790
- Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby, Tila.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,807
What, are you afraid of the
big, bad Graveyard Shark?

7
00:00:29,807 --> 00:00:31,020
(tongue ululates)
(Chad laughs)

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,443
- You're such an ass, Brad.
- Yeah, but you love it, Beth.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,983
- Don't worry, baby.

10
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:41,010
I'll keep you safe from the
big, bad Graveyard Shark.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,650
Besides, it's just a story they tell kids

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,790
to keep 'em from fucking around

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,010
and drinking in this old ass graveyard.

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,251
- You sure?
- Would I lie to you?

15
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,670
(tense music)

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,727
- Yo. You coming, Chad?
- I will be in a minute.

17
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:57,227
Come on, baby. Live a little.

18
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,863
- [Beth] So what exactly
is a Graveyard Shark?

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,850
- You don't know about
the Graveyard Shark?

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,780
- No, not really.

21
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,240
I mean, I'm kind of a new
kid to the area, remember?

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,100
I only moved here a few months ago.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,680
- Oh, shit, you're right.
Baby, you're in for a treat.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,910
Chad, you gotta tell her the story.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,314
- Gotta tell the story.

26
00:01:34,314 --> 00:01:35,820
- She doesn't wanna hear the story.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,315
Just thinking about it freaks me out.

28
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:39,360
- I don't know. I kind of wanna know.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,490
I'm into that freaky, weird shit.

30
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,323
- I don't know, babe.

31
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:44,160
It sounds like she
wants to hear the story.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,930
Let me tell you.

33
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,670
It was, (throat clears) it
was a dark and stormy night

34
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,730
when a fisherman caught
something in his net.

35
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,110
It wasn't just a creature

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,380
but a grotesque abomination
covered in scales,

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,380
eyes black as pitch, a gaping
maw used to tear asunder.

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,810
The fisherman, fearing
what it was that he caught,

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,570
buried the creature
here in this graveyard,

40
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,623
hoping that the sacred
grounds would purify its soul.

41
00:02:13,623 --> 00:02:17,130
- Hate this story.
- So that's it? (laughs)

42
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,780
I don't know what there
is to be scared of.

43
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,760
- Oh, no, no. I wish that was it.

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,820
They say that sometimes you
can still see a fin bobbing

45
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,110
in between the graves.

46
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,810
There was a family had
a picnic right here,

47
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,070
and they were found dead, torn
apart, ripped limb from limb.

48
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,600
So the town went into a panic.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,340
They locked up the graveyard

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,013
to keep whatever was in from getting out,

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,930
and the Graveyard Shark waits, lurking,

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,503
hoping someone foolish
will enter his domain.

53
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:48,843
(Brad cries out)
(women gasp)

54
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:50,520
(Brad laughs)

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,830
- Nice one, Brad.
- You're such a fucking dick.

56
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,870
- I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

57
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,138
- All right.

58
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:57,990
I think it's enough of all
that spooky talk for now.

59
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,353
- Yes, right. That's good.

60
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,728
- It's time to get freaky deaky!

61
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,227
(upbeat electronic music)
(group cheers)

62
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:10,963
- Have I mentioned how I
fucking love this girl? (laughs)

63
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,491
- To be young and carefree.
- Oh, (laughs) no.

64
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,802
You have another thing coming

65
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,658
if you think we're
getting all freaky deaky

66
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:24,897
in this graveyard.

67
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:26,160
- Are you sure there's nothing I can do

68
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,393
to make you change your mind?
- No.

69
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:50,018
- Are you ready, baby?

70
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:51,540
For me to bring that thunder down under?

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,140
- Just shut up and give it to me already.

72
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,557
(Graveyard Shark growls)

73
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,240
(Graveyard Shark roars)
(Brad cries out)

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,349
(soft eerie music)

75
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,182
Brad?

76
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,819
(Graveyard Shark growls)

77
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,819
Brad! I told you spooky
time is over with, Brad!

78
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,757
(Graveyard Shark growls)

79
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,859
Can you just come on and fuck me already?

80
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,375
(dark dramatic music)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

81
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,958
(Beth screams)

82
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,480
- Did you hear that?
That sounds like Beth.

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,127
- It's just Brad and Beth.
They're fucking around.

84
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,290
- No, it doesn't sound
like fucking around.

85
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,384
What if their hurt?
They could be hurt for-

86
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:37,823
- They're fine, baby. Come here.

87
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,700
- Seriously, okay?

88
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,700
- All right, I'll go, but when I get back,

89
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,490
this is going in that oh so
sweet mouth hole of yours.

90
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,347
- Okay, we'll see.
- Fucking cock block.

91
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:56,102
(Graveyard Shark growls)

92
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:58,269
Did you hear that?
- What?

93
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,409
- Hello? Hello?

94
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,619
(Graveyard Shark growls)

95
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,452
Oh, what the fuck? Oh, fuck, Beth.

96
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:11,118
(Tila screams)
(dramatic music)

97
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:12,180
(Graveyard Shark roars)

98
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,049
Oh, fuck!

99
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:16,299
(Chad and Tila scream)

100
00:05:18,474 --> 00:05:19,474
- Tila, run!

101
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:28,732
(flesh squelches)
(Chad shrieks)

102
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,218
(Tila whimpers and sobs)

103
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:51,065
- No!

104
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,949
(Graveyard Shark growls)

105
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,949
(Tila screams)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

106
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,343
(flesh squelches and rips)

107
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:20,404
(Graveyard Shark roars)

108
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,740
- Have you spotted a big
hairy creature lurking

109
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,093
in the woods?

110
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,312
(tense music)

111
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:42,993
Or maybe your b-beach
getaway is being interrupted

112
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,580
by unknown sea creatures,

113
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,790
or maybe your livestock's brains

114
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,970
are being sucked out by Chupacabra.

115
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,180
You can give us a call for that, too.

116
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,500
Go on, I can't hear you!
- My God!

117
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,690
Don't take off the mask! You're Bigfoot!

118
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,390
Because we investigate everything strange

119
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,480
and bizarre from unknown creatures

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,850
to spooky paranormal activity.

121
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,830
- What about aliens, man?

122
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,310
What are you gonna do about
the existence of UFOs?

123
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,720
- Don't be weird, buster.
Aliens aren't real.

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,124
We're here to solve the
real mysteries of the world.

125
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:24,790
I, I don't understand. It
doesn't even make narrative sense

126
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,140
for you to be that close.

127
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,810
If you've got monster problems,

128
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,810
give us a call, and we'll
kick 'em in the balls.

129
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,500
- Well, what do you think?

130
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,227
I, it's got a few kinks,

131
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,060
but I think it's got some charm to it.

132
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,673
Pretty cool.
- Okay, Greg, I'm not really,

133
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,400
I don't really think there's
a nice way to say this,

134
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,640
but that's, that video's
like kind of dog shit.

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Like, did you try? Your Bigfoot
head fell off in the middle.

136
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,700
That's, that's bad.
That's like actively bad.

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,410
- Abby, I worked all night on this.

138
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,060
Mother got upset with
me that I skipped dinner

139
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,210
to finish working on it.
- Okay, whatever.

140
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,110
Post it, I guess,

141
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,940
but honestly, if this does
not drive up business,

142
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,231
we're probably gonna have to call it quits

143
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,357
- Call it quits?
- or whatever.

144
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,190
- Why would we call it quits?

145
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,390
- Well, Greg, I don't really
know if you've noticed,

146
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,620
but the monster hunting business

147
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,420
isn't really like a lucrative one,

148
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,800
which I probably should've known

149
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,090
when my guidance counselor laughed at me

150
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,590
for three minutes straight
when I said I wanted

151
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,540
to major in cryptozoology, but-

152
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,090
- I, I've been meaning to
ask you about that, Abby.

153
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,070
What, what is cryptozoology?

154
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,600
I, it's just that Mother's
been pestering me and, well-

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,640
- Are you for real right now, dude?

156
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,480
Cryptozoology is a pseudoscience

157
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
that studies and tracks down legendary

158
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,660
or extinct creatures
whose current existence

159
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,320
is either unknown or unsubstantiated.

160
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Duh. So you can tell your
bitch ass mother Debbie that.

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,630
- No, no. Unsubstantiated.
- Uh huh, yeah.

162
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,520
You're doing that thing
where you nod your head

163
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,450
like you know what I'm saying,

164
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,980
but I could totally tell you don't,

165
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,300
and I have to tell you this, too.

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,430
If your butt didn't look so
cute in your little work pants,

167
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,070
I probably would've fired
you a long time ago.

168
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,470
We are hunting down creatures, okay?

169
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,250
Like Bigfoot, the yeti, the,
the Fresno Nightcrawlers,

170
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,490
the, the Loch Ness Monster,
the Loveland frog man,

171
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,223
the Squonk, the, the, the, Werebear, the,

172
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,740
- The Graveyard Shark?
- the Graveyard Shark.

173
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,903
Wait, what?
- Abby Westcott.

174
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,330
My name is Dr. Jan Lovnik,

175
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,790
and I'm here to hire you to help deal

176
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,298
with our town's Graveyard Shark problem.

177
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,120
- Graveyard Shark? That
is a, it's a new one.

178
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,130
- There have been eyewitness reports

179
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,670
of a shark-like creature that
haunts our town's graveyard.

180
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,850
Recently, four teenagers
went into the graveyard

181
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,400
and disappeared with no sign of them.

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,230
Local authorities say it's all hoax,

183
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,464
that there's nothing to worry about,

184
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:44,430
that is all just a case of mass hysteria.

185
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,850
- Well, that is typical
of a coverup, isn't it?

186
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,640
So what can you tell us
about the eyewitness reports?

187
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,050
- I think it would be better

188
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,750
if you heard from the survivors yourself.

189
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,280
I'm a therapist.

190
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,420
I lead a support group

191
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,900
for the victims of the Graveyard Shark.

192
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,340
I would like to invite you to come in,

193
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,340
sit down with them, and
hear their stories yourself.

194
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,900
We have a meeting coming up tomorrow.

195
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,733
- Okay.

196
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,011
- I really hope you can make it.

197
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:09,844
- Yeah, I mean, we're busy,

198
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:10,677
but we can try to make something-

199
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:11,510
- But we're not.

200
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,343
We're not doing anything.
- Shut up.

201
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,176
Yeah, we're very busy, but we'll be there.

202
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,220
We'll, we'll make it work.

203
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,810
- I hope we'll see you tomorrow.

204
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,770
- [Abby] Yeah.

205
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,603
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

206
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,820
Oh my God, Greg, this is it!

207
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,070
This is, this is our big
break. Pack the bags.

208
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,930
We're going monster
hunting. Let's go right now.

209
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,358
Let's go, let's go.
- Just a quick message

210
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:30,515
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- to my mother.

211
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:31,468
- Fuck Debbie. Gimme that.
- Let-

212
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:32,340
- Come on, let's go.
- Ow!

213
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,133
- We gotta go now. I, come on!

214
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,480
- [Reporter] This is MF Radio News,

215
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,400
and we interrupt your regular programming

216
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,690
for a breaking news report.

217
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,360
Four teenagers have gone
missing over the weekend

218
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,670
in the quiet town of Willsboro Point.

219
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,550
The last known location
was near the old graveyard,

220
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,860
sending shockwaves through the community.

221
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,560
Authorities are scrambling
to piece together the events

222
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,450
leading up to their disappearance.

223
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,280
We reached out to Sheriff McDermott

224
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,840
for a statement on the situation.

225
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,520
When asked about the missing teenagers,

226
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,860
he assured us that law
enforcement is doing everything

227
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,690
in their power to locate them.

228
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,210
Pressed further about
any potential foul play,

229
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,240
Sheriff McDermott offered
a cautious response.

230
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,920
The sheriff concluded the interview

231
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,930
by issuing a warning to the public.

232
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,120
As we wait further updates
from the authorities,

233
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,610
we urge residents to remain vigilant

234
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,140
and report any information

235
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,873
that may aid in locating
these missing teenagers.

236
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:26,997
(doors open)
(dramatic music)

237
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:29,414
(door slams)

238
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,653
(doors clatter)

239
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,570
- Let's go a little easier on the.

240
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,389
(door rattles)

241
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,639
- Goddammit, Greg.
- Sorry.

242
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,390
- It's almost 20 people missing.

243
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,129
- Yeah.
- Graveyard Shark's horrible.

244
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:14,940
(people whisper indistinctly)

245
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,860
- They're probably okay.
- All right, everyone.

246
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,233
Let's take our seats and get started.

247
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,143
- Greg, you a Graveyard Shark survivor?

248
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,730
No donuts for you, okay?
Those are for survivors.

249
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,647
- Sorry.
- You're just a guy.

250
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,647
Like are you kidding me?

251
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,283
- Take your seats please.
- Sorry.

252
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:43,110
- No.
- I'm sorry.

253
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,943
- Thank you.

254
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,530
Group, today we have a very
special guest joining us.

255
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,480
This is Abby Westcott.

256
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,190
She's a specialist in the
weird, abnormal creatures.

257
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,470
I ask her to join us here today

258
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,630
so that she could hear your stories

259
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,330
and get a better
understanding of what it is

260
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,560
that you're going through

261
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,960
and hopefully provide some answers.

262
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,540
- Thank you guys so much for
sharing your stories with me.

263
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,870
I'm really hoping that I can
maybe provide some answers

264
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,580
and understand what you guys

265
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,590
are going through a little bit more.

266
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,210
- Thank you.

267
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,423
So, who would like to start us off today?

268
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,640
- My name's Chip, Chip Conners, and-

269
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,673
- It's okay, Chip. We're in
a safe space here, all right?

270
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,063
- I'm a survivor of a
Graveyard Shark attack.

271
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,783
It's been two years since it happened.

272
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,170
My girlfriend, Ginger,
thought it would be romantic

273
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,525
to have a picnic in the graveyard.

274
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,760
(soft piano music)

275
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Ginger, it has been the most
amazing 132 days with you.

276
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,723
- It really has been the best
132 days of my entire life.

277
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,370
- Ginger, I've, I've been thinking.

278
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,510
- Yes?
- Ginger,

279
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,545
there's nobody else in the whole world

280
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:14,610
that I would rather spend the
rest of my life with than you.

281
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,480
Ginger Eloise.
- Oh.

282
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,060
- Will you marry me?
- Oh, yes!

283
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,103
Yes, Chip Conners! I will marry you!

284
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,737
Oh. Oh my God.

285
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:27,837
Oh. Oh.

286
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:34,492
And now I think it's time

287
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:38,602
that I gave you a little gift as well.

288
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:39,435
- Oh.

289
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,368
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

290
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:48,368
(Ginger screams)
(flesh squelches and rips)

291
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:05,220
I panicked. I just froze there.

292
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,980
As I watched the Graveyard
Shark eat her whole

293
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,310
in front of me, I couldn't move!

294
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,900
I couldn't breathe!

295
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,420
The person I just decided to
spend the rest of my life with

296
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,263
was eaten by a shark in
front of me, and I, I-

297
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,570
- Chip, Chip, it's okay.
We're all safe here.

298
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,473
What do we say?

299
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,150
- I'm not prey. I'm a survivor,
and I will not be eaten.

300
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,920
- Everyone join in.

301
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,033
- [Unison] I'm not prey.

302
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:40,293
I'm a survivor, and I will not be eaten.

303
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,093
- Very good. Thank you, Chip.

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,470
Sadie, how about you
share your story next?

305
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,510
- Sure. I don't mind going next.

306
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,660
My name is Sadie. I'm a model
if you can't already tell.

307
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,893
You can follow me on my
Fans account, Sadiebaby6412.

308
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,980
- It's for the research, the research.

309
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,140
- I went out to the
graveyard a few months ago

310
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,614
as part of like a spooky
Halloween shoot for my Fans page.

311
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:05,880
(soft music)
(camera beeps and clicks)

312
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,680
- Yeah, that's it. Move to the left.

313
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,003
That's the stuff, Sadie baby.

314
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,130
(soft up-tempo guitar music)

315
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,893
Let's slowly pull up that sheet.

316
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:23,050
You're killing it. These
are freaking amazing.

317
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:31,117
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(tense dramatic music)

318
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:37,016
- Shark!

319
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,590
(photographer screams)
(flesh squelches and rips)

320
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:00,722
(Graveyard Shark growls)

321
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:08,850
(Graveyard Shark roars)

322
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,890
And it was just really fucked up

323
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,380
how that Graveyard Shark
just up and ruined my shoot,

324
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,880
you know?
- Ruined.

325
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,220
- I'm still waiting on the
edits from the photographer.

326
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,100
I mean, it's been months
now. How unprofessional.

327
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,790
- Sadie, the photographer is dead.

328
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,760
- That sounds like a her
problem, not a me problem.

329
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,663
- All right, thank you so
much for sharing, Sadie.

330
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,530
I see we have someone
new in our group today.

331
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,750
Would you like to introduce yourself?

332
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,790
- Oh, hey. I'm Doug.

333
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,403
My friends call me Doug or Doug.

334
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,540
- Hi, Doug.
- Sup. So check it.

335
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,560
Me and my friend Pookie,

336
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,410
who definitely isn't my
drug dealer or anything,

337
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,820
we went for a little walk

338
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,493
after a little of that
Downtown Brown Donna Juana.

339
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:56,993
(toy creaks)

340
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,490
You know what would go good

341
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,470
with this Sweet Fuzzy Lady, Pookie?

342
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,630
- Some of that sweet
ass Cow Cream Freezies?

343
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,463
- Hell yeah.

344
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:06,750
I'm talking that
two-scoop sticky situation

345
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,070
with the dome a la mode.

351
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,740
- Lay it on me, Pookie.

352
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,560
- Two guys, one cup.
- Two guys.

353
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,991
- [Unison] One cup.

354
00:18:26,991 --> 00:18:28,879
- Vanilla and strawberry.
- Go!

355
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:31,252

357
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,234

(Doug moans)
(singer sings indistinctly)

368
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,080
- I, I'm sorry,

369
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,490
but what does any of this have
to do with a Graveyard Shark?

370
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,430
- What's a Graveyard Shark?
- Are you kidding?

371
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,780
We've all been sitting around here talking

372
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,720
about this horrible monster who's killed,

373
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,300
murdered people we all know and care for.

374
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,500
- Speak for yourself.

375
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,750
I don't even know the photographer's name.

376
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,040
- Okay. That's besides the point.

377
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,569
The point is he's a killer,
and he will kill again.

378
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,500
(pen scribbles)

379
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,430
- Mm-hmm, well, that ain't
the smartest thing I heard all

380
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,870
through this little stupid ass meeting

381
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,132
'cause I warned y'all.

382
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,590
Didn't I warn y'all? I warned
all y'all crazy white folks.

383
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,380
I warned you. I warned you.

384
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,870
I know I warned your dumb
ass sitting right there.

385
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,390
Oh, I definitely warned
this bitch right here,

386
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,050
but I warned all of y'all just
like I warned, look it here,

387
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,960
all these stupid white folks
on this wall right here!

388
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,780
I warned this bitch. She ain't listen.

389
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,020
Where she at now? Worm food, motherfucker!

390
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,860
I warned her. I especially warned his ass.

391
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,037
His ass sitting up here like,

392
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:11,490
"Ooh, ain't no shark gonna get me."

393
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,970
Guess what? Shark got the
motherfucker, didn't it?

394
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,280
Sure as shit did.

395
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,050
I warned them just

396
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,650
like I'm warning y'all
white motherfuckers!

397
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,270
But you ain't listening!

398
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,320
Instead of hauling and getting
the fuck up outta here,

399
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,030
y'all sitting up in here talking

400
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,857
about what the Graveyard
Shark done did now.

401
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,700
"Oh, the Graveyard
Shark done took my mama.

402
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,040
The Graveyard Shark done took my daddy.

403
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,820
The Graveyard Shark shark this.
The Graveyard Shark there."

404
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,180
Respectfully, you can suck
my dick from the back,

405
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,580
expeditiously, no condom.

406
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,670
Slurp, slurp, motherfucker. Slurp, slurp.

407
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,020
If you were smart,

408
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,380
you'd get your dumb asses
the hell up outta here

409
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,243
before you fuck around and find out!

410
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,740
You know what?

411
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,080
Miss White Lady, is these
donuts, are they free?

412
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,730
- Yes, yes, please.
- I'm gonna take take them.

413
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,535
- Take them all.
- Thank you.

414
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,368
(people speak indistinctly)

415
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,050
- Y'all don't listen.

416
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,173
Gonna be one ear and out
the other with y'all.

417
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,750
How do you open this damn door? Unlock.

418
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,073
- It's a push.
- Unlock!

419
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:21,390
- Just gotta push.

420
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,540
- Do I push or pull?
- Push the metal bar, please.

421
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,130
Thank you.
- All right.

422
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,810
Thank you all. God bless.

423
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,823
You have a good day. Toodles.

424
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,380
- Who was that jackass?

425
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,620
- Oh, that's Captain Isaac Seyburn.

426
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,100
He's kind of a local fisherman
who goes around yelling

427
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,340
at people and warning them
about the Graveyard Shark.

428
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,493
He does it every week. I
think it's for the donuts.

429
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,423
Anyway, everybody, let's grab hands.

430
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,970
Repeat after me. I'm not prey.

431
00:21:58,603 --> 00:22:00,000
- [Unison] I'm not prey.

432
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,183
I'm a survivor, and I will not be eaten.

433
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,810
- I think we'll conclude
our session here today.

434
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,643
Thank you all.

435
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,650
- Do you mind if I say something?

436
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,843
- Oh, sure.
- Great.

437
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,090
Thank you guys for sharing
your stories with me today.

438
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,020
Really want you to know

439
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,330
that I know what you're going through,

440
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,060
and I know how it feels to have somebody

441
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,590
that you really care about get
horribly mauled and murdered

442
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,503
in front of you by an
indescribable horror.

443
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,020
When I was a little girl,

444
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,690
my dad got completely eviscerated

445
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,780
in front of me by a, a monster,

446
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,092
a monster that I couldn't
describe at the time

447
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:44,760
and, and I still really can't.

448
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,770
No one had ever seen anything like it.

449
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,540
It was a monster,

450
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,220
and everyone thought
that I was making it up,

451
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,070
that it was something that I made up

452
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,960
to avoid the reality of the situation,

453
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,840
but I know, I know that the reality is

454
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,630
is that there are monsters in this world,

455
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,980
and I know they're real.

456
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,950
So I've dedicated my
life to cryptozoology,

457
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,340
studying these monsters, these
legends, and these myths.

458
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,710
I'm gonna get the answers,
I'm gonna get the evidence,

459
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,290
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna get
rid of this Graveyard Shark,

460
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,020
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna put
an end to this reign of terror

461
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,483
that's gripping all of you, I promise.

462
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,553
Okay.

463
00:23:21,553 --> 00:23:23,340
(Greg claps)

464
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,390
- Okay.
- Abby. Truly moving.

465
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,100
- Thanks, Greg.
- My eyes are welling up.

466
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,840
- Yeah, it's really embarrassing
when just one guy claps,

467
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,673
so.
- But I thought they

468
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,640
would've joined, but they,
- Okay, well, they didn't.

469
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,330
- They, no.
- So, yeah.

470
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,810
- Abby, if there's
anything I can do to help,

471
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,430
just please let me know.
- Great.

472
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,420
Well, I think it's time we need

473
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,020
to visit the scene of the crime.

474
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,280
- Okay. I will show you the way.

475
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,519
- Great.

476
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,519
(contemplative music)
(birds chirp)

477
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,633
- Well, let's just keep an eye
out and be careful in there.

478
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,770
While I don't believe there
is actually a Graveyard Shark,

479
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,053
I do believe we should
exercise some caution.

480
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,140
- Well, if you don't believe
there's a Graveyard Shark,

481
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,367
what do you think is going on?

482
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,400
- I don't know. Maybe police is right.

483
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,040
Maybe it is a case of mass hysteria.

484
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,310
People who are trauma
bonded by horrific events

485
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,590
have created this collective
image in their heads

486
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,960
of a shark eating their loved ones,

487
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,690
all to mask themselves from grief.

488
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,400
I had a colleague with a patient

489
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,980
who thought that he was a panda.

490
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,600
He lived his life as one,

491
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,840
all to just avoid facing the
truth about losing his parents.

492
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,360
- Okay, doctor, that's
an interesting theory,

493
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,550
but that's all it is, a theory.

494
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm here to uncover the
truth about what's going on.

495
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,483
- All right.
- Well,

496
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,570
seems like a pretty
normal graveyard to me.

497
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,300
- Yeah, well, it would to
a simpleton like you, Greg,

498
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,550
but if you use your eyes,

499
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,715
you would see that this
place is not kept up.

500
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:56,190
I, I mean, the grass is
overgrown. It's almost abandoned.

501
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,910
The roads are destroyed.
People are kept outta here.

502
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,815
They're scared of this
place. Get the camera ready.

503
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,220
Come on, let's go.
- Oh.

504
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,660
- Let's go.
- Hey!

505
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,083
- Come on! Keep walking.
- I'm working on it. Hold on.

506
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,620
And we're rolling!

507
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,300
- Abby, the Monster Hunter here.

508
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,670
I am in a small fishing
village on the shores

509
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,340
of Lake Champlain in a
cemetery that is said

510
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,660
to be the hunting grounds

511
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,340
for the horrible creature the locals

512
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,410
are calling the Graveyard Shark.

513
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,450
The locals are describing
this as something

514
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,870
out of the darkest
fantasies of HP Lovecraft,

515
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,230
a humanoid shark beast
with a giant shark fin,

516
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,550
a slippery skin,

517
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,220
and a mouth that would put
a great white to shame.

518
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,710
It's my duty to you,
my fans and followers,

519
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,840
to uncover the truth about the mystery

520
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,193
of this Graveyard Shark.
- Hello? Hello?

521
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,910
Yes, this is her. (scoffs)

522
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,580
No, no, I'm good with my
car's current warranty.

523
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,483
Thank you very much. I've
had enough of these calls.

524
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:06,550
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(dramatic music)

525
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,133
This place of giving
me the jeepy creepies.

526
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:12,660
(Graveyard Shark growls)

527
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,253
Hello?

528
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,250
(Graveyard Shark growls)

529
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,883
Hello? Is anybody there?

530
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:24,570
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(Jan screams)

531
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,880
- That sounded like the doctor.

532
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,290
- Maybe she fell and got hurt?

533
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,270
- Greg, come on. That's so stupid.

534
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,370
Let's go check on her.

535
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:37,285
(flesh squelches and rips)
(Jan screams)

536
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,779
(Graveyard Shark growls)

537
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:44,125
(claws slice)
(flesh squelches)

538
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,814
(claws slice)
(flesh squelches)

539
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:48,980
(Graveyard Shark roars)

540
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,360
- What in the devil was that?

541
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,040
- [Greg And Abby] Graveyard Shark!

542
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,110
- Get that camera rolling.
Maybe we can get it on film.

543
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,300
Come on.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

544
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,203
And we're rolling!

545
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,850
We just heard what could
be the deathly growl

546
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,190
of the Graveyard Shark
right on the other side

547
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,743
of these woods, so you guys follow us.

548
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,573
(tense music)

549
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:14,040
Oh my God. Oh.

550
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,667
Greg, cut the camera. Call 911.

551
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,970
Fuck, fuck! Oh my God, okay.

552
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:22,336
All right, okay, all right.

553
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,600
Okay, we're gonna apply pressure. Okay.

554
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,660
No, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.

555
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,103
We'll just, we'll put these back, okay?

556
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:31,484
It's okay. You're gonna be fine.

557
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,015
Let's put it back and-

558
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:36,170
(blood spurts and squelches)
(Jan gags)

559
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,809
Okay, we'll just put this
back, and you'll be fine.

560
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:40,364
- It's real, the-

561
00:27:40,364 --> 00:27:42,199
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

562
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,227
(dramatic music with vocals)

563
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,060
Fuck!

564
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:47,650
Fuck!

565
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,447
(dramatic rock music)

566
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,370
- We've searched this graveyard over,

567
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,330
and there's no sign of a shark, ma'am.

568
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,650
Now you wanna tell me the real reason

569
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,060
why you were trespassing?

570
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,770
This is a closed off area.

571
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,440
- My story remains the same, officer.

572
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,020
The doctor hired us to
investigate the Graveyard Shark,

573
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,000
and she was attacked and killed by it.

574
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,110
- And you say you saw this
so-called Graveyard Shark?

575
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,190
- No, we didn't see it, but
we heard this creature sound.

576
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,780
- It sounded a bit like ruhr.

577
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,750
- So you heard a, a monster sound.

578
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,292
Is that right?
- Yeah.

579
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,125
- Anything else?
- Yeah!

580
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:46,777
When, when she was dying, she said,

581
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:49,560
"It's real, the graveyard."

582
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,080
- She said what now?
- Well, I think she was trying

583
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,570
to say, "It's real, the Graveyards Shark."

584
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,890
- But she didn't actually say it.

585
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,290
- No, she didn't get to finish it because

586
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,110
- Uh huh.
- she died, so.

587
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,230
- Sheriff, can I have a word for a moment?

588
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,960
- Sure thing, Deputy. Wait here.

589
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,250
- Mm-hmm. Not liking this at all.

590
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,560
- It's like they're not
even trying to listen to us.

591
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,330
I gave him a monster sound and everything.

592
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,490
- Yeah, it's probably best
if you never do that again.

593
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,043
- I thought it would help.
- It definitely didn't.

594
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,380
- Well, I mean, all evidence is pointing

595
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,660
towards a bear attack.
- A bear attack.

596
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,630
Are you even listening to us?
- Oh, I'm listening.

597
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,630
Now you said you, you heard,
what was that sound again?

598
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,550
- Ruhr.
- Yeah.

599
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,680
See, that sounds like a bear to me.

600
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,600
- Now that I think about it,
it does sound like a bear.

601
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,740
He might be right.

602
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,870
- This area's known for bear attacks.

603
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,450
There's a den just over
the mountains over there,

604
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,070
and they come down here, they get hungry,

605
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,230
and they start rummaging
for food and such.

606
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,850
- Okay, well what about all the reports

607
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,490
of shark attacks in this area?
- Really?

608
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,470
Now that's just some
old town folklore meant

609
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,460
to scare the kids.

610
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,283
Now, honestly, do you see
any water around here?

611
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,800
- No.
- How is a shark supposed

612
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,740
to thrive and survive without water?

613
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,573
- Well-
- Now,

614
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:13,560
before you say another word,

615
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,420
I'm gonna give you nice folks a chance

616
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,230
to walk away and go home, all right?

617
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,660
Now, I'm not gonna press any charges.

618
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,423
I'm gonna need this for evidence though.

619
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:26,090
(Greg whimpers)

620
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:31,023
But I tell you what, if
I see you here again,

621
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,950
y'all gonna be knee deep
in a world of trouble.

622
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,740
You got that?
- Yes, officer.

623
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,323
- Good. Now go on, get.

624
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,100
We've got some real police work to handle.

625
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,933
- [Abby] Okay.

626
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:48,330
- Now we don't have time

627
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,273
to be chasing imaginary shark monsters.

628
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,723
- Yep.

629
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,933
- Thank you? So what now?

630
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,000
- Probably a change of clothes

631
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,080
and a hot shower and I don't know.

632
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,850
This is really fucking fishy,

633
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,830
and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

634
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,830
- Really fishy. Wait,
bears like to eat fish.

635
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,820
Maybe it's something's connected here.

636
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,306
- Oh my God. Knock it the fuck off, Greg.

637
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:22,139
- I'm...

638
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,030
- Deputy Amendolare, Campbell,
I leave cleanup to you.

639
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,400
I've got some business
to handle at the station.

640
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,927
Don't fuck off like you did last time.

641
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,840
- Yes, sir.
- Get it done. Hurry back.

642
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,090
- Yes, sir. You know
you could count on us.

643
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,933
- I mean it.

644
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,080
- Why you always gotta
mess with the sheriff?

645
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,790
- The sheriff's a dick, all right?

646
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,780
He talks out of his ass,

647
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,300
and he always leaves us
with the shit details.

648
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,300
I mean, sir, look at this, look at this.

649
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,160
Literally shit-filled
intestines. Are you kidding me?

650
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,589
- This is-

651
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:00,690
- Can't we just leave
it here and let it rot?

652
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,190
I mean, I'm sure the
bear's gonna come back

653
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,390
for it anyway, huh?

654
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,640
- Do you honestly think a bear did this?

655
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,020
- Seriously? Who cares, okay?

656
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,492
I'm too sober for this shit anyway.

657
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:13,650
- Well, I have an idea.
- Yeah? What's that?

658
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,580
- How about you and me have a little fun?

659
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,322
- Okay. What'd you have in mind, huh?

660
00:32:20,322 --> 00:32:23,373
- How about you pound this ass,

661
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,590
and then we'll smoke this grass?

662
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,993
- Okay.

663
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:28,827
(both laugh)
(tense brooding music)

664
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,320
- Told you I was fucking naughty. (laughs)

665
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,903
(Deputy Amendolare chuckles and moans)

666
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,189
Take that.

667
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:44,730
But you know Mommy likes
when I'm in charge.

668
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,259
- Oh! Easy.

669
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:48,283
- Ooh, but you like it.

670
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:53,158
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(Deputy Campbell chuckles)

671
00:32:53,158 --> 00:32:58,158
There. Stay.

672
00:32:59,017 --> 00:33:01,748
- Ooh, okay. You bringing the cuffs in?

673
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:03,827
- Yeah. Are you my pet right now?

674
00:33:03,827 --> 00:33:05,033
- You know I am.

675
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,955
(dramatic music)
(cuffs click)

676
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:10,515
(both giggle)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

677
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:13,598
(both pant and moan)

678
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,770
- [Radio Host] Welcome,

679
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,490
fellow seekers of the
mysterious and unknown,

680
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,478
to another episode of
"Cryptozoology Chronicles."

681
00:33:23,478 --> 00:33:26,061
(tense music)

682
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:39,567
(water splashes)

683
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:49,020
And, if you will, a world
where the boundaries

684
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,820
between human and animal blur,

685
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,730
where creatures of myth
walk among us disguised

686
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,810
in the skin of men.

687
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,040
If werewolves exist,

688
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,260
what other were-creatures
might lurk in the shadows?

689
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,290
Could there be were-pigs
roaming the countryside

690
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,990
under the light of the full
moon or perhaps were-deer

691
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,630
with antlers that pierce
the veil between worlds?

692
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,570
And then there's a notion of
something even more sinister,

693
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,773
were-bears.

694
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:14,604
(water splashes)

695
00:34:26,475 --> 00:34:28,410
- You see, Abby, we have a responsibility

696
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,470
to the people to discover
new forms of life

697
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,570
and uncover this world's mysteries.

698
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,240
- But hasn't everything
already been discovered, Dad?

699
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,980
- Modern science has barely begun

700
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,990
to scratch the surface
of what's out there.

701
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:44,580
We discover 15,000 new
species of plants, animals,

702
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,790
and insects every year.
- That is pretty cool.

703
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:51,420
- This world is a vast one
full of many mysteries, Abby,

704
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,630
and let's not forget what
lies beyond our world.

705
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,580
Have a look around.

706
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:59,725
(footsteps shuffle)

707
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,277
Could this be wolfsbane?

708
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:08,521
(tense dramatic music)

709
00:35:08,521 --> 00:35:10,150
No, no, it...

710
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,150
(creature roars)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

711
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:20,086
(blood spurts)
(dad cries out)

712
00:35:20,086 --> 00:35:21,833
(young Abby screams)

713
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:22,895
(Abby screams)

714
00:35:22,895 --> 00:35:24,420
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

715
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,368
- Greg, what the fuck?
- Sorry!

716
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:28,458
I, I heard you were screaming.
There was a panic attack.

717
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,370
- Greg, have you heard of knocking?

718
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,560
- I, I'm sorry! I was
concerned about your wellbeing!

719
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,320
- Give me, give me a fucking
towel. Get the fuck out.

720
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,119
There's a message on the, on
the message board for you.

721
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,419
- Okay, get out!
- Sorry.

722
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,670
- God, I needed that.
- Yeah.

723
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,692
Well, you know, whenever I'm
on duty, I please that booty.

724
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:55,530
- Mm, that you sure do. (laughs)

725
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,423
- So can you uncuff me now?

726
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:03,143
- Uncuff you?
- Yeah. Uncuff me.

727
00:36:03,143 --> 00:36:05,250
- What? You don't wanna
go round two, officer?

728
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,050
- I do. Not like this.

729
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,840
- You know you like it when I'm naughty.

730
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,883
- Yeah, I do.

731
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,789
- I might just have to
do like cavity search.

732
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:17,220
- (laughs) The fuck you are.

733
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,220
- I'm just joking, you big
baby. Now where are my keys?

734
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,830
- You're fucking joking, right?
You better have those keys.

735
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,463
- Oops. I don't know if I can find them.

736
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,501
(Deputy Campbell groans)

737
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:38,670
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(tense dramatic music)

738
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,883
- What was that?
- What was what?

739
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,753
- I heard something moving over there.

740
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,143
- Who's out there?
- Hello?

741
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,673
- Are you fucking with me?
- No. I heard something.

742
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:57,399
(Deputy Amendolare screams)
(Graveyard Shark roars)

743
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,232
What the fuck?

744
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:03,480
Let her go! Let her go!
- Help me!

745
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,404
- Dammit, let her go!

746
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:11,449
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(Deputy Amendolare screams)

747
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:12,301
Come on!

748
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:14,537
(Deputy Amendolare screams)
(flesh squelches and rips)

749
00:37:14,537 --> 00:37:15,454
Let her go!

750
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:21,522
(Graveyard Shark slurps and chews)

751
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:34,130
Whoa! (groans)

752
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,130
(flesh squelches and rips)
(blood spurts)

753
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,660
(Graveyard Shark roars)

754
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:50,190
- Okay, okay. Professional.

755
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,180
- So about before, I was-
- You know what? It's fine.

756
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,370
It's actually okay if we
never talk about that again

757
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,070
and actually if you forget
everything that you saw.

758
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,893
That's cool, too.
- Of course.

759
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,441
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Zip zap zop.

760
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:09,780
(mouth beeps and whistles)
Control alt delete.

761
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,490
- Yeah, that was-
- Just like that.

762
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,632
- [Abby] Yeah.

763
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:13,770
- Are you sure we want
to delete? It's deleted.

764
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,450
- You are a weird and off-putting man.

765
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,050
I don't know if you've been
told that enough in your life.

766
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:19,883
Okay, weirdo.

767
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,060
So what was this message
you wanted to show me?

768
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,350
- Oh, right here. Just
showed up on the fan page.

769
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,500
- Okay, let's see.

770
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,560
"I tried to warn you, but you
didn't listen. Nobody listens.

771
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,470
Now the Graveyard Shark
has claimed another victim.

772
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:37,057
If you really do seek
the truth," all caps,

773
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,960
"let the Graveyard Shark come
to O'Brien's Pub tonight,

774
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,967
and all will be revealed."

775
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,981
- Punctuation's terrible.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

776
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,290
But this is it though. This is it.

777
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,330
Real leads always have
terrible punctuation.

778
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,910
This is probably it. Okay, I'm gonna go.

779
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,500
I'm gonna follow this up.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

780
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,730
Let's go. Greg, come on, let's go!

781
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,347
- Actually, it's getting a bit late,

782
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:02,880
and the drive here was exhausting.

783
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,010
I was going to turn in for the night.

784
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,960
Mother doesn't like me
going out super late

785
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,030
in a unfamiliar place.

786
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,296
Just, I think I'll turn in

787
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:12,600
so we can get a fresh start tomorrow.

788
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,703
- Okay, yep. Whatever, weirdo.

789
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:19,170
I'll see you tomorrow then.
- And please be careful.

790
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,273
- Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

So you're the one that messaged me?

- Mm-hmm. Have a seat, little girl.

806

- I, I was planning on it. Whatever.

807
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,313
So you have information
about the Graveyard Shark?

808

(liquor sloshes)
(tense music)

809

So if I were you, I'd
use that brain of yours

811
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,260

Oh yeah. (chuckles) I've
seen him on my own two eyes.

815
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,343
He's evil, he's unstoppable,
he's an abomination,

816
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,310
and it's because of me he exists.

817
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,323
- What do you mean because of you?

818
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,163
- Oh boy.

Look at me. Look at me.

875
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,680
Look at me. What's your social security?

876
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,640
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck

877
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,976
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

878
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:26,893

882
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,690
with the really weird, unnecessary-

883
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,628
- There we were,
- Nope.

884
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:43,711
laying there in the bliss

885
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:50,140
of our ungodly and adulterated
sex, just butt ass naked,

886
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,130
just sweating in each other's sex juices,

887
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:00,000
listening to the harmonious
sounds of the swamp

888
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,810
before she swam away, leaving me alone.

889
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,643
- Okay, thank God.

890
00:45:04,643 --> 00:45:06,900
So I don't know what this has to do

891
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,980
with the Graveyard Shark.

892
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,750
Can we please get back to that?

893
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,020
- I searched for her everywhere!

894
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:15,542
- Okay.
- Every night

895
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:18,450
and in hopes of getting
caught up in that sweet,

896
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,583
sweet tuna pussy once again.

897
00:45:21,715 --> 00:45:24,326
Have you ever had tuna pussy before, miss?

898
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:26,424
- Nope.
- Ooh, whoa!

899
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,320
You don't know what you missing.
Knock it till you try it.

900
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,720
Now that shit will have you caught up.

901
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,580
That shit will get you sprung.

902
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,130
That shit so good, that
shit nice and tight.

903
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,643
Shit sound like this. Sometimes
you gotta get up in there.

904
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:41,160
Gotta like that. You hear that?

905
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,670
Oh, here you go, baby.
Oh, oh, where we going?

906
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,990
- [Abby] Are you gonna eat any of this

907
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,130
or just like finger it?

908
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,644
- Oh, I don't waste no food now, baby.

909
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:55,644
(tense brooding music)
(mermaid hums)

910
00:45:57,097 --> 00:46:00,723
I don't believe it. Yeah,
I knew you'd come back!

911
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:09,960
I'll be damned. (laughs)

912
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,687
What you got there, girl?

913
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:14,963
Come on, lemme see. Quit playing.

914
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,730
The hell is that?
- Our love child.

915
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,495
- Bitch, the fuck it is.

916
00:46:22,495 --> 00:46:25,912
(Graveyard Shark growls)

917
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,580
- So now that child daddy now,

918
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,310
I'm gonna need your help raising my son.

919
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,583
I'm gonna need some money.
Babies aren't cheap.

920
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,090
(laughs) Don't think you're
just gonna be some sort

921
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,407
of a deadbeat father because
you live up on the land.

922
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:46,863
- Right, right. True, true.

923
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,110
Well I'm gonna give you
this little motherfucker,

924
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:53,250
I mean, our love child.

925
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,430
I'm gonna go over this way

926
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,503
and grab that child support, okay?

927
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:05,330
But not for nothing,
but you sure it's mine?

928
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,820
Maybe there's some kind
of mistake or something.

929
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,170
- No mistake.

930
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,730
- Hey, I didn't mean it like that.

931
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,760
- You think I'm some ho?
- Hey, I ain't judging.

932
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,340
- You think I'm out there
letting other fishermen love

933
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,720
with my finest self?
- Hey.

934
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,492
You've been gone for six months.

935
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:21,325
I don't know where the hell you-

936
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:23,490
- You are the only man
who been up my fish guts.

937
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,810
- I don't know. You could be saying any-

938
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,350
- Besides, look at him.
- Yeah.

939
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,450
- He looks just like you.
- That's cat, bitch.

940
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:33,400
- So don't be telling me some
bullshit like it ain't yours.

941
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:36,600
- All right, you know
what? I don't wanna argue.

942
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,310
What I'm gonna do is get you this money.

943
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,727
We'll handle all the affairs later, okay?

944
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:41,580
I don't want no trouble, all right?

945
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,503
So let me just get you this money.

946
00:47:43,503 --> 00:47:47,450
You want our 20s or 50 bills
or what you, ah, bitch!

947
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,988
(spade thwacks)
(flesh squelches)

948
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:56,405
(Graveyard Shark grunts)

949
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:03,245
(Isaac screams)
(spade thwacks)

950
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,250
- Jesus fucking Christ!

951
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,050
- No, no. You don't get to judge me.

952
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,330
What laid before me was
the horrendous results

953
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,623
of consensual sex between
a man and a half fish.

954
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:21,030
Now I have stared into
the eyes of the devil,

955
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,240
its eyes so black and so cold,

956
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,373
its eyes staring right back at me,

957
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,666
staring right into the
depths of my very soul.

958
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:33,563
Now what the hell was
I supposed to do, huh?

959
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:35,640
Ashamed of what I did,

960
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,210
I decided it was best to
bury them in the graveyard

961
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,330
in the hopes that the holy
ground would help cleanse,

962
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,890
purify, and protect the world
from the, the ungodly act

963
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,740
that I performed with that mermaid,

964
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,200
no matter how erotic they were,

965
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,890
and that the ramifications
of our naughty, nasty sex

966
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,050
that created that demonic spawn

967
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,263
would stay buried for all of time.

968
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:04,381
Lord have mercy on me.

969
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:12,334
(footsteps shuffle)
(fog hisses)

970
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,174
(shovel thuds)

971
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:16,674
(dirt thumps)

972
00:49:17,773 --> 00:49:20,260
I thought my secret would stay buried

973
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,513
along with that bastard and his mother.

974
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,090
Somehow, he managed to cling to life

975
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,297
and dig himself up out of that hole

976
00:49:33,297 --> 00:49:37,170
and stay in that graveyard for
many years with no trouble,

977
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,083
no incident at all until a few years.

978
00:49:44,534 --> 00:49:47,010
A few years ago, the killing started.

979
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:49,620
- You should be so ashamed of yourself.

980
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,810
This is all everything you've done.

981
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,563
This whole situation
could've been avoided.

982
00:49:54,563 --> 00:49:59,563
- (chuckles) You know, I
used to think that, too,

983
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,090
until the killing started
and I began to hear rumors

984
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:14,090
of this shark creature running
around, and believe you me,

985
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,110
I didn't believe it for one second either.

986
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:18,760
I thought it was all bullshit,
to be honest with you,

987
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,026
that is until I start searching myself.

988
00:50:24,026 --> 00:50:29,026
(tense dramatic music)
(fog hisses)

989
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:39,542
(woman and Isaac scream)

990
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:43,217
(Graveyard Shark growls)

991
00:50:43,217 --> 00:50:48,217
(flesh squelches)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

992
00:50:51,326 --> 00:50:53,990
(body thuds)

993
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,645
You all right, bitch? Oh, damn.

994
00:50:56,645 --> 00:50:59,104
(Graveyard Shark growls)

995
00:50:59,104 --> 00:51:02,338
You better stay your ass,
stay your big ass over there!

996
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:03,343
No! Don't you creep!

997
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:06,992
Don't you, why you,
Jesus, he's so menacing!

998
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:10,159
Oh, Jesus, please! Oh, he's so sweaty!

999
00:51:11,356 --> 00:51:12,189
Ow! Ow!

1000
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:17,776
And there I was face
to face with the beast,

1001
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:22,826
face to face with my son.

1002
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:26,076
(tense brooding music)

1003
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,330
Part of me wishes I
had never knocked boots

1004
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,363
with that fine ass mermaid,

1005
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,320
laying this pipe deep
down into them fish guts.

1006
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:44,857
Sometimes I ask myself, "Was
it worth it?" (chuckles)

1007
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,860
But my biggest regret, well,

1008
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,740
that's not killing that son of
a bitch when I had a chance.

1009
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,110
- Okay, so what are you
gonna do about it now?

1010
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:57,360
Have you tried contacting
the local authorities?

1011
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,200
- I tried.

1012
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,320
Called the authorities,
warned the town folk,

1013
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,620
but you know what they do?

1014
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,590
Call me a drunkard, label
me as the local loony,

1015
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,470
crazy Captain Isaac,

1016
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,160
and still go up in that goddamn graveyard

1017
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,270
where they get attacked,

1018
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:18,780
and these sons of bitches
blame it on bear attacks.

1019
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,310
So you know what I'm gonna
do? Not a goddamn thing.

1020
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:26,220
- I see. Okay, well, you know what?

1021
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,690
If you're not gonna do something about it,

1022
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:28,980
then I guess I'll have to.

1023
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,930
So somebody else will have to go take care

1024
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:32,370
of the monster that you created.

1025
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,120
- Well, you're gonna die if you do.

1026
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,037
So if I was you,

1027
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:42,090
I'd get my ass up outta
here while you could.

1028
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,420
- Okay, well, I might die,
but I'm not running away.

1029
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,570
I made a promise to myself
that I would not be a coward,

1030
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,540
and I couldn't live with myself if I hid

1031
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,910
from all the monsters in
this world behind a bottle.

1032
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,670
So it's time for somebody to
stand up and do something.

1033
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,503
So you know what?

1034
00:52:57,503 --> 00:52:58,336
You can just stay here

1035
00:52:58,336 --> 00:53:00,840
and fist your macaroni salad or whatever,

1036
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,130
and I'll go deal with it.

1037
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:03,356

00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,457

1060
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,800
What's got you so flustered
like a banana nut cluster?

1061
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,760
- Are you talking to me?

1062
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,830
- Who else would we be
talking to, little mama?

1063
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:57,210
You look like you could use a little

1064
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,430
of the old Colorado whipped cream.

1065
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,500
- One, no idea what you're talking about.

1066
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,120
Two, I am full grown.

1067
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,850
Three, I am definitely not your mom!

1068
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,040
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
look stressed is all.

1069
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,650
- I am stressed! It's been a day.

1070
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,072
- Lay it all out like
dirty Neapolitan, girl.

1071
00:54:13,072 --> 00:54:14,670
- Okay, well, I just
found out the horrifying

1072
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:17,428
and nightmarish truth
behind the Graveyard Shark.

1073
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,660
- What, that that loony fisherman guy

1074
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,240
fucked a fish creature?
- Yeah! Why do you know that?

1075
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,620
- Tells everyone that.

1076
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,330
- It's kind of a weird flex, right?

1077
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,170
I mean, especially the part

1078
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,760
where he murdered her with a shovel.

1079
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,220
If I had a mermaid girlfriend,
I would treat her right.

1080
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,810
I would take her to meet my parents.

1081
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,310
I would do the dishes half the time,

1082
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,840
which I imagine is pretty fucking easy

1083
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,160
to do under the water,
and I wouldn't murder her!

1084
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,740
I would go down on her like
a stinky snow cone, though,

1085
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,530
because I am a generous lover.

1086
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:47,100
It's often been said, "Can't
spell Pookie without two Os."

1087
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,734
- Hell yeah, like nasty melt
tote a la mode flash cone.

1088
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:51,567
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1089
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,740
- Yeah, I would just love
it so much if we could talk

1090
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,700
about anything but
going down on a mermaid.

1091
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,950
- Hey, different strokes
for different folks.

1092
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,990
I mean, who are we to
judge what a man does

1093
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,832
with a fish creature?

1094
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,470
In the end, it's all just love.

1095
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,790
Isn't that what's important?

1096
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,070
- Well, yeah. I mean, I guess.

1097
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,950
Love is really what is
the most important thing.

1098
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,321
- Yeah.
- So.

1099
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:13,154
- All right, so now
that you know the truth

1100
00:55:13,154 --> 00:55:15,210
about this Graveyard
Shark, what you gonna do?

1101
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,890
- That I don't know 'cause this

1102
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,260
is really overwhelming and confusing.

1103
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,230
- Sounds like she could
use a little advice

1104
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,353
from the green goddess herself.

1105
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,980
- No, I'm overwhelmed and confused.

1106
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,750
So I should probably keep a level head.

1107
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,393
You know? - Oh.

1108
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:34,080
- Trust in the process
of the mean green dragon

1109
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,258
for a paradigm shifting
epiphany of botanical knowledge.

1110
00:55:38,258 --> 00:55:40,740
- It's good. It's so good.

1111
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,880
- Okay, this will help? Like-

1112
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,100
- It's like vitamins
and shit. It's natural.

1113
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,320
- It's natural and healthy.
It's from the earth.

1114
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,420
- Okay, yeah. Right, okay.

1115
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,172
- There you go.
- This is good for me.

1116
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:52,102
- Yeah. I knew she was cool.

1117
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:53,296
- Right?
- Right?

1118
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:54,510
- Nice.
- All right, yeah.

1119
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,522
What's the worst that could happen, right?

1120
00:55:56,522 --> 00:55:58,196
- (laughs) Yeah, dude.
- I, I know what I'm doing.

1121
00:55:58,196 --> 00:55:59,618
I, I could do this myself
- There you go.

1122
00:55:59,618 --> 00:56:01,268
- 'cause I've done it
many times obviously, so.

What's great about not feeling good?

I don't know what to do right now.

1141
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:58,410
- Well, what is it I've always said?

1142
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,500
- That we have a responsibility

1143
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,020
to the people to discover new life forms

1144
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,183
and uncover the world's mysteries.

1145
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,510
- We also have the
responsibility to protect them

1146
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,410
from monsters that exist, like
a certain Graveyard Shark.

1147
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,840
- Yeah, that's what I don't
know what to do something about.

1148
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,250
I feel like there's nothing I can do.

1149
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,030
Like, well, I couldn't protect
you or save you back then.

1150
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,920
- There's nothing that you could've done

1151
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,270
to save me back then.

I'm not special.
- You not special?

00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,823
Now that's a joke. You're my daughter.

1158
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,210
You have everything you need

You know, thank you for being
vulnerable and honest with me.

01:00:00,825 --> 01:00:04,007
(flesh squelches)
(Bigfoot screams)

1197
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:05,340
Yeah. All right.

1198
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,090
You think I should just
sit on your face instead?

1199
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,963
Yeah, okay. Come on. Let's do that.

1200
01:00:24,028 --> 01:00:27,194
(Abby sighs and moans)

1201
01:00:27,194 --> 01:00:30,194
This is way better than fisting you.

1202
01:00:36,018 --> 01:00:38,302
What the fuck, what the
fuck, what the fuck.

1203
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,885
(Abby screams)

1204
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,740
- Please tell me we didn't.
- Didn't what?

1205
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:53,610
- Didn't, you know, you and me in the bed.

1206
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:54,840
- What are you doing with your hands?

1207
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,051
- Touching and
- I don't know

1208
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:58,806
what you're trying to say.
- bumping uglies

1209
01:00:58,806 --> 01:01:03,017
or scrumbling and-
- What are you trying to say?

1210
01:01:03,017 --> 01:01:06,030
- Bed pressing and please
don't make me say it.

1211
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,560
Did, Greg, did we have sex?

1212
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,173
- Oh, ew! No.
- Ew? Why are you ewing it?

1213
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,380
- Mother wouldn't find it
appropriate, that's all.

1214
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,193
- What is wrong with you?

1215
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:19,860
Okay. Also, what happened last night?

1216
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,890
Because I have a really bad headache.

1217
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,170
- I'll have you know, there's
nothing wrong with me.

1218
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:27,330
Mother and I have confirmed
that I'm a perfectly normal,

1219
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:30,600
rational thinking young
cub, thank you very much.

1220
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,860
You strolled last night very
late with those two lads

1221
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,190
covered in ice cream who
have absconded elsewhere.

1222
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:39,840
You threw me outta the bed,

1223
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,180
you grabbed the mask from the box,

1224
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:47,180
and things got rather peculiar
between you and that mask.

1225
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,120
- Okay, you can delete
those memories as well.

1226
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,263
- Pyoo! Gone.

1227
01:01:54,064 --> 01:01:55,110
Anywho,

1228
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,230
anything good from last night
about the Graveyard Shark?

1229
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,740
- I, I did actually.

1230
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,870
I discovered its origins,

1231
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:03,270
and I think I sorted some stuff out,

1232
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,740
and I know what we need to do next.

1233
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:07,413
- And what is that?
- Find a way to kill it.

1234
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:15,120
- Jesus, Henry! Have some
respect for your father.

1235
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,370
- It's Hendrick now, Mother.

1236
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,440
God, I don't even know
why we come out here year.

1237
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,680
Dad died six years ago,
and let's be honest,

1238
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,150
he was an awful human.

1239
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,060
- Your father loved
you more than anything.

1240
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,863
- He never cared or gave a
crap to know the real me.

1241
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:37,151
- He didn't mean that. He loves you.

1242
01:02:37,151 --> 01:02:42,151
(tense brooding music)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1243
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:56,743
- Henry, come here!

1244
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:59,362
(upbeat electronic music)

1245
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:02,612
(tense brooding music)

1246
01:03:05,193 --> 01:03:06,026
What the?

1247
01:03:06,026 --> 01:03:07,543
(Graveyard Shark roars)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1248
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:10,498
(upbeat electronic music)

1249
01:03:10,498 --> 01:03:13,589
(dramatic music)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1250
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:16,181
(upbeat electronic music)

1251
01:03:16,181 --> 01:03:21,181
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(grass rustles)

1252
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:23,613
- Ma! You ready to go?

1253
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:25,517
(tense dramatic music)

1254
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:27,017
Ma. Where are you?

1255
01:03:30,351 --> 01:03:31,924
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1256
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:36,924
(Henry screams)
(body thuds)

1257
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:44,865
(Henry screams)
(blood squelches)

1258
01:03:45,099 --> 01:03:48,682
(flesh squelches and rips)

1259
01:03:50,445 --> 01:03:55,445
(soft tense music)
(Sheriff McDermott sighs)

1260
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,123
- Deputy Amendolare, what's your 10-20?

1261
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,813
Deputy Campbell report in.

1262
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,630
Goddamn, if they're fucking off again,

1263
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:14,080
there's gonna be hell to pay.

1264
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,850
I can't leave them numbskulls alone

1265
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:21,033
for one minute and do a goddamn thing.

1266
01:04:23,377 --> 01:04:26,070
(tense dramatic music)

1267
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,920
Campbell, is that you messing around?

1268
01:04:29,313 --> 01:04:32,480
(slow dramatic music)

1269
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,643
Time to start going through
resumes again. Damn bears.

1270
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,819
(tense music)

1271
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:13,874
- [Ghost Dad] Abby, you
must destroy all monsters.

1272
01:05:15,289 --> 01:05:17,643
- Okay, time to face my fears.

1273
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:25,674
(footsteps thud)

1274
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:32,490
- So you ready for this?
- I am.

1275
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:35,123
It's time to put an end to
this monster's reign of terror.

1276
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,610
- You don't have to do this alone.

1277
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:39,990
- What are you guys doing here?

1278
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:42,900
- These two over here
told us you were here

1279
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,100
and that you're going
after the Graveyard Shark.

1280
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,110
We want in.
- No, no, no, no.

1281
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:47,430
It is way too dangerous.

1282
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:49,230
- What, and it's not
too dangerous for you?

1283
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:52,263
- How about it, Pookie?
- No.

1284
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:56,583
That is to say no thank
you very much. I'm good.

1285
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:02,820
- We are survivors of the Graveyard Shark.

1286
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,380
We are doing this for everyone we know

1287
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,640
who's fallen to him.

1288
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,740
We wanna do this for the doctor.

1289
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,827
- For the doctor.
- For the doctor.

1290
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,780
- For the doctor.

1291
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,190
- For the doctor.

1292
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,530
- What was it the doctor would always say?

1293
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,420
- [Unison] I am not prey.

1294
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:26,132
I am a survivor, and I
and I will not be eaten.

1295
01:06:26,132 --> 01:06:26,965
- Cat!

1296
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:36,350
That's cat. That's fake
news, bitch! (laughs)

1297
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:39,540
Did I come at a bad time,

1298
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,180
or y'all still doing y'all
little stupid ass chants?

1299
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,890
- Yeah, no, we're all
just surprised to see you

1300
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,660
'cause we all thought
you'd just be drinking

1301
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,943
and crying still.
- (gasps) Oh!

1302
01:06:49,733 --> 01:06:53,786
Well, appears that I've
run out of the good shit.

1303
01:06:53,786 --> 01:06:55,440
(bottle clatters)

1304
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,750
So if y'all done dillydallying,

1305
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:00,630
I figured we'd get down to some business.

1306
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,340
I created this monster.

1307
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,990
It's only right that I
help put and end to it,

1308
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,240
but y'all don't look strapped up.

1309
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,150
Y'all don't look like y'all
got none of that fire power.

1310
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,340
- We've got some, so aye, aye, captain.

1311
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,290
- [Isaac] All right, let's do it, baby.

1312
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,039
(upbeat rock music)

1313
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,263
- All right, let's strap up.

1314
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:28,019
(Isaac grunts)

1315
01:07:36,396 --> 01:07:38,491
(hedge clippers snip)

1316
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:41,074
(chains clink)

1317
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,450
- Okay, so this graveyard is huge.

1318
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:52,680
We're gonna have to split into teams

1319
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,600
so we can cover all the ground.

1320
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,210
Greg and Sadie, you're
gonna go to the north part.

1321
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,590
There's a lot of woods up there,

1322
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:00,210
and those trees are gonna
diminish visibility.

1323
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,830
So you guys really have
to have each other's backs

1324
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:03,150
and keep an eye out.

1325
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,040
Doug and Chip, the southern part.

1326
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,720
Now be careful because
there's a pond down there

1327
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,430
that obviously the shark
could be living in.

1328
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:11,340
So stay away from that.
Captain, you're with me.

1329
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:13,380
We're gonna go right to the
center of the graveyard.

1330
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,260
That's where the mausoleum is
and lots of old structures,

1331
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,378
any of which could house a
lair for the Graveyard Shark.

1332
01:08:19,378 --> 01:08:22,470
(Isaac grunts)

1333
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,700
Be carefully vigilant.

1334
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,410
If you run into him,

1335
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:28,743
please send out a signal
so everybody knows.

1336
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,250
We'll all reconvene because only together

1337
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,893
can we defeat this monster.
- You can count on us.

1338
01:08:40,872 --> 01:08:44,498
(music distorts in slow motion to a stop)

1339
01:08:44,498 --> 01:08:48,480
(Isaac grunts)
(gate creaks)

1340
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,924
Push it because that's a
push. What do you not get?

1341
01:08:50,924 --> 01:08:55,319
- I got it. I thought I'd kick
it, make me look more badass.

1342
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:00,120
(soft eerie music)
(birds caw)

1343
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,590
- All right then, captain,

1344
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:03,720
what made you have your
big change of heart?

1345
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,810
'Cause I thought you'd still
be at the bottom of a bottle.

1346
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,900
- Oh hush, girl, you don't
know nothing about me,

1347
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,220
and I was gonna get around to it.

1348
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:14,523
I just never got around to it, that's all.

1349
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:20,360
Wanna know the truth? I, I
was a little scared, yes.

1350
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:24,663
I'm man enough to own up to
that. I admit it right now.

1351
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:30,813
That's kind of how life's
always been for me.

1352
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:35,970
Things get a little,
little scary, a little,

1353
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,723
little complicated, a little rough.

1354
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:42,723
I usually run away, turn
to the bottle as a crutch,

1355
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,880
but just seeing the look of hope

1356
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,250
on y'all faces just lit a fire under me,

1357
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,010
made me feel like I
can do this damn thing.

1358
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:55,010
If I gotta kill my own son or
even die myself in the process

1359
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,780
to ensure that you or
anybody else doesn't suffer

1360
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,730
at the fate of that damn Graveyard Shark,

1361
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:02,700
then, then goddammit, so be it.

1362
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,020
- Okay, captain, you know what?

1363
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,750
That was almost an inspiring speech.

1364
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,450
So I want you to know
your intentions are noble,

1365
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:13,830
and nobody's gonna die today.
- No, that's where you wrong.

1366
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:16,770
See, I said I was gonna try to make sure

1367
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:19,020
that that Graveyard
Shark don't kill us all.

1368
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,760
Don't mean that ain't nobody gonna die.

1369
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,182
Somebody gonna die.
- No, we have a plan.

1370
01:10:23,182 --> 01:10:24,015
We're ready for it.

1371
01:10:24,015 --> 01:10:27,127
- As my grand mama LaRenda
used to say, she said,

1372
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:32,127
"Son, somebody gonna
get that asshole eaten."

1373
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,353
- That's not how people die.
- "Son.

1374
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,688
Somebody gonna get that asshole eaten."

1375
01:10:39,688 --> 01:10:41,100
- Yeah, I heard you the first
time, and I'm still telling,

1376
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:41,933
that's-
- Son.

1377
01:10:45,673 --> 01:10:46,506
- Don't do that.

1378
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:49,830
- Hmm, asshole eaten.

1379
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,505
- Yeah. I get it.
- Let's go.

1380
01:10:51,505 --> 01:10:54,319
- So ass eating is actually not a-

1381
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:56,040
- It means death.
- No, no, no.

1382
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,540
I think you'd actually really like it

1383
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,070
if we talked about it a little more.

1384
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:00,496
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1385
01:11:00,496 --> 01:11:01,731
Again, you're missing out.

1386
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:04,981
(tense brooding music)

1387
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:09,000
- Suppose we're supposed to be

1388
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,193
around here according to the map.

1389
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,520
Hey, it's, it's going to be all right.

1390
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,180
Just, just stay close to
me and I can keep you safe.

1391
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,490
- So are you and Abby a couple?

1392
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:23,940
- Well, she, she and I, I, no, no.

1393
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:27,300
She's my, she's my boss.
She's my boss, she's my boss.

1394
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,850
- Does that mean you're single?

1395
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:34,110
- I, I suppose yes, yes, technically.

1396
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:35,610
- What is a big strapping hunk

1397
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:38,160
of a man like you doing single?

1398
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,960
- Oh, Mother won't let me date.

1399
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,960
It's better that I am
remain single. You coming?

1400
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,519
- Yeah. Just don't kill me, creep.

1401
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:51,936
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1402
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:56,310
- So there we were, me and Pookie,

1403
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,470
about to get some of
that St. Louis soft serve

1404
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,450
from our Persian goddess when we were hit

1405
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:02,550
with the Coogie Bay
Special from Dairy Dan,

1406
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,900
the ice cream man.

1407
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,360
It was all right, but it
was no Oklahoma Sundae

1408
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,310
from Maggie Moose Fluffy Penguin.

1409
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,320
You know what I'm saying?
- No, no.

1410
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,910
I have no idea what you're saying.

1411
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,440
I don't think anybody does.

1412
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,390
Can we, can we please just
focus on the task at hand?

1413
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,340
- We got this like Sticky Wilbur.

1414
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,437
- That looks like the
pond that was on the map.

1415
01:12:19,437 --> 01:12:21,660
- Yo, this looks like a
double scoop of Bone Chiller

1416
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:23,310
that has cream on the inside,

1417
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,353
clean on the outside sort of vibe.

1418
01:12:25,353 --> 01:12:26,640
(tense music)

1419
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,650
- I would like to avoid finding out

1420
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:30,543
what's on the inside at all costs.

1421
01:12:32,975 --> 01:12:37,975
(water laps)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1422
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,803
- Captain, look.
- I see.

1423
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,080
Yeah, that's leading
right through there, too.

1424
01:12:50,257 --> 01:12:51,210
So tell me, little girl,

1425
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:53,280
how many creatures you actually
came face to face with?

1426
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,180
Quick.
- Okay, well,

1427
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,750
technically just one, and
it was a long time ago.

1428
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,660
My dad got murdered by a
creature in front of me,

1429
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,950
so just since then,

1430
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,770
I've just been trying to
prove their existence.

1431
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:05,603
Ugh!

1432
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,043
- Still fresh.
- Ew.

1433
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,760
- Well, I'm sorry for your loss,

1434
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,400
but we gonna get you
your first kill tonight!

1435
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,277
- Okay.
- You ready?

1436
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:18,450
- I am.
- You kill 'em, I fuck 'em.

1437
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:23,151
That's what I say. (laughs)
Not necessarily in that order.

1438
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,552
(laughs)

1439
01:13:24,552 --> 01:13:25,385
- Okay.

1440
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:31,459
(birds chirp)
(footsteps shuffle)

1441
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,390
(Graveyard Shark roars)

1442
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:34,590
- What was that?

1443
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,140
- I've heard that sound before,

1444
01:13:37,006 --> 01:13:38,220
but I was told by a lovely police officer

1445
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,723
that's the sound a bear makes.

1446
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:43,320
- Have you ever heard
a bear sound like that?

1447
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,890
- Well, Mother sometimes gets
cranky in the, nevermind.

1448
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,909
We should just keep moving.
We might be getting closer.

1449
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:54,909
(tense guitar music)
(footsteps shuffle)

1450
01:14:00,124 --> 01:14:02,040
(Graveyard Shark roars)

1451
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,720
- Please tell me that you heard that.

1452
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,860
- Yes indeedy.

1453
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,260
- Do you think it was the Graveyard Shark?

1454
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,942
- Undeniably.

1455
01:14:08,942 --> 01:14:12,192
(tense dramatic music)

1456
01:14:13,246 --> 01:14:15,829
(chains clink)

1457
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:23,499
(Doug and Chip yell)

1458
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:28,481
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(dramatic suspenseful music)

1459
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:30,717
(body thuds)
(Chip groans)

1460
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:34,078
(punch thuds)
(Doug grunts)

1461
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:38,507
You don't wanna do me.
(speaks indistinctly)

1462
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,900
Fuzzy Blizzard Fudgie Wudgie.

1463
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:44,850
- You have taken everything away from me!

1464
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,813
This is for Ginger!

1465
01:14:46,764 --> 01:14:50,847
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(punch thuds)

1466
01:14:50,847 --> 01:14:53,430
(chains clink)

1467
01:14:57,286 --> 01:15:01,440
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(chains clink)

1468
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,790
Quick, shoot the flare!
It'll alert the others!

1469
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:06,898
(flare pops)
(punch thuds)

1470
01:15:06,898 --> 01:15:07,976
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1471
01:15:07,976 --> 01:15:10,860
I'm not prey. I'm a survivor,
and I'll not be eaten.

1472
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:14,043
I'm not prey. I'm a survivor,
and I'll not be eaten!

1473
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:16,930
(Graveyard Shark roars)
(dramatic music)

1474
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,680
(water splashes)

1475
01:15:22,554 --> 01:15:25,221
(Chip whimpers)

1476
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:34,492
(dramatic music)
(Chip whimpers)

1477
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,392
(Graveyard Shark roars)
(water splashes)

1478
01:15:39,392 --> 01:15:42,059
(water burbles)

1479
01:15:48,153 --> 01:15:50,370
(tense music)
(footsteps shuffle)

1480
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:55,370
- Look up at the sky!
- That's a signal all right.

1481
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:56,760
- Do you think that that
means that they found them?

1482
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,690
- Must be.

1483
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,450
Judging by the trajectory,
it came from the south.

1484
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:02,070
We should go see if they need a hand.

1485
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:04,380
You just stay close to me
and I'll keep you safe.

1486
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,110
- I like this version
of Greg. So fearless.

1487
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:10,380
I bet Mother would be proud.
- (laughs) Well, just as long

1488
01:16:10,380 --> 01:16:12,090
as we get this wrapped
up before nightfall.

1489
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:15,603
Mother hates if I'm out
after dark. Come on.

1490
01:16:27,716 --> 01:16:30,647
- All right. So how deep do
you think these tunnels go?

1491
01:16:30,647 --> 01:16:32,940
'Cause it feels like we've been walking

1492
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,863
for an awful long time.
- I dunno.

1493
01:16:39,779 --> 01:16:40,973
Do you see these pipes right here?

1494
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:43,460
- Yeah.

1495
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:47,330
- Looks like they connect
to the sewer system.

1496
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:52,080
If that's the case, these
pipes, they lead into town,

1497
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,050
which is probably the reason

1498
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:58,380
how this damn beast can
get from place to place.

1499
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,020
I say we keep our eyes open
because if we're not careful,

1500
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,360
he can just pop outta anywhere right now.

1501
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,060
- Great. Super comforting thought.

1502
01:17:07,457 --> 01:17:08,730
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(footsteps shuffle)

1503
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:11,267
- Oh God, where is it coming from?

1504
01:17:11,267 --> 01:17:12,100
- Sh, sh.

1505
01:17:17,627 --> 01:17:21,435
(Graveyard Shark growls)
(Greg cries out)

1506
01:17:21,435 --> 01:17:23,113
(claws slice)
(flesh squelches)

1507
01:17:23,113 --> 01:17:25,780
(Greg sputters)

1508
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:28,410
- Come on Sadie, baby. What do I do?

1509
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,590
You got this. Too hot to die.

1510
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,130
Oh, there's nothing but a man deep down,

1511
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:38,310
and I've honestly had sex
with much worse looking older,

1512
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,260
fat, sloppy men for money.

1513
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:45,260
Stop right there. You
don't wanna eat me, do you?

1514
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:48,420
Or maybe I want you to eat me.

1515
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:52,650
Must be so lonely, never having
the loving touch of a woman.

1516
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,767
Let's Sadie baby take care of you.

1517
01:17:56,058 --> 01:17:59,225
(slow dramatic music)

1518
01:18:13,828 --> 01:18:18,661
(Graveyard Shark and Sadie pant and moan)

1519
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,667
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1520
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:34,633
- Ugh.
- Well, goddamn.

1521
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,030
- Well, it definitely looks like somebody

1522
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:41,040
is living down here.

1523
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,270
You think this could be the
lair of the Graveyard Shark?

1524
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,762
- I don't know.

1525
01:18:46,762 --> 01:18:50,012
(tense brooding music)

1526
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:54,240
Oh, but, well,

1527
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,120
looks like they got some
good ass taste in movies.

1528
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,083
Oh shit! I ain't seen this one yet.

1529
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:00,916
You know, originally,

1530
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:02,670
this was called "Three Days
in the Woods Killing Time,"

1531
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:04,560
but they moved it down to just

1532
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,477
- Captain.
- "Killing Time" because-

1533
01:19:06,477 --> 01:19:08,263
- Look at these.

1534
01:19:08,263 --> 01:19:10,110
If these are all the Graveyard Shark,

1535
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:14,130
this fundamentally changes
our understanding of him.

1536
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:18,406
It's bizarre. It's kind
of like he's human?

1537
01:19:18,406 --> 01:19:20,073
- No. No, he's still a monster.

1538
01:19:21,699 --> 01:19:23,813
It's best you remember that.

1539
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:25,350
It's best you also remember
what we came here to do,

1540
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,183
and that's put an end

1541
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:28,465
to the son of a bitch's reign of terror.

1542
01:19:28,465 --> 01:19:29,298
- Okay.

1543
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,938
- What did I say about seeing you?

1544
01:19:32,938 --> 01:19:34,234
- Oh no, Sheriff.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1545
01:19:34,234 --> 01:19:35,535
- It's good you're here
because the Graveyard Shark-

1546
01:19:35,535 --> 01:19:37,202
- Drop your weapons.

1547
01:19:38,071 --> 01:19:39,243
- What?
- I said drop it!

1548
01:19:39,243 --> 01:19:40,290
- Okay, okay. It's down.
- Been there, done that.

1549
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:41,310
Got the motherfucker-
- Turn around.

1550
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,840
Put your hands up against
the wall just like this man.

1551
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,233
- Are we gonna do that?
- Come on, do it!

1552
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:49,893
- That was amazing. You're like a machine.

1553
01:19:50,979 --> 01:19:55,979
(head thuds)
(tense dramatic music)

1554
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,378
(leaves rustle)
(Doug breathes through teeth)

1555
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,211
- I feel like I was hit

1556
01:20:00,211 --> 01:20:02,823
with Pasadena Pounder
Strawberry Nut Sucker, damn.

1557
01:20:04,831 --> 01:20:07,331
(Doug grunts)

1558
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,300
- Ah, shit. That ain't good.

1559
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:23,043
Hold on, Sadie. Doug's coming.

1560
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:25,920
- [Isaac] How you walking, sir?

1561
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,573
Rodney King or Martin Luther?

1562
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,593
Oh, come on. I ain't watched that yet.

1563
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,287
- Okay, listen, we
didn't do anything wrong,

1564
01:20:36,287 --> 01:20:38,520
so you can just let us go.

1565
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,100
- I warned you about
trespassing in this graveyard.

1566
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,357
You were lucky the
first time I let you go,

1567
01:20:42,357 --> 01:20:45,270
but this time, you will
not be leaving here alive.

1568
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:48,497
- Oh shit. I left the teapot on.

1569
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:53,497
(dramatic music)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1570
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:59,609
- Oh my God.

1571
01:21:05,674 --> 01:21:07,841
- She, she, she all right?

1572
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:12,079
(footsteps shuffle)

1573
01:21:15,142 --> 01:21:18,225
- No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

1574
01:21:20,198 --> 01:21:22,486
- [Isaac] It's, it's all
right. It's all right.

1575
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:25,346
He ain't gonna hurt you. It's all right.

1576
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:26,179
- All right. Back down, back down.

1577
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:30,208
You'll get your feast.
Let me talk to 'em first.

1578
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:32,987
Why don't, why don't you play
with your new toy over there?

1579
01:21:43,136 --> 01:21:46,110
- Goddammit, Sheriff! Now
what the hell is going on now?

1580
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,670
- See, now normally,

1581
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,800
I wouldn't take the
time to explain myself,

1582
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,973
but you, captain, pissed
me right the hell off.

1583
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,960
I think you deserve to know
the reason why you will die.

1584
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,120
You see, I was at the graveyard that night

1585
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:03,210
that you were trying
to bury away your sins.

1586
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,910
Now I'd just lost my,
my own wife and child,

1587
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:07,260
not a week prior.

1588
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,493
Horrible car crash,

1589
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:13,080
and I'd give anything to
have them back in my life.

1590
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:17,313
I was on my knees pleading
for them to come back to me,

1591
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:20,420
and then I heard you.

1592
01:22:27,561 --> 01:22:30,644
(tense guitar music)

1593
01:22:33,653 --> 01:22:36,153
(spade thuds)

1594
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:05,581
(tense music continues)

1595
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:08,164
(metal clinks)

1596
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,627
(fog hisses)

1597
01:23:43,716 --> 01:23:47,466
(Sheriff McDermott whimpers)

1598
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:02,888
(Graveyard Shark grunts)

1599
01:24:15,358 --> 01:24:18,775
(Sheriff McDermott sobs)

1600
01:24:22,011 --> 01:24:22,844
- As I looked into his eyes,

1601
01:24:22,844 --> 01:24:25,830
I knew that the heavens had
given me a second chance

1602
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:28,013
to have my son.
- You dumb son of a bitch you!

1603
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:33,000
That ain't no damn blessings
from the heavens span.

1604
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,710
That's an abomination from hell!

1605
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,080
- I'll slap the shit outta you.

1606
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,840
As someone who has never
experienced true loss,

1607
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,050
I wouldn't expect you to
understand God's gift.

1608
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,930
- Okay, you know what? You're
clearly fucking insane.

1609
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:49,427
He's out there killing people,
and you're letting him do it.

1610
01:24:49,427 --> 01:24:51,570
You're supposed to be
protecting and serving.

1611
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,280
That's your fucking job, man.

1612
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,690
- Protect and serve?
- Yeah!

1613
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:57,300
- To serve the people who kept me away

1614
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,150
from protecting my own wife and child?

1615
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:04,590
No. Now the people are ungrateful
for the gifts they got.

1616
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,990
If they had known about my boy here,

1617
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:08,130
they would've joined the captain

1618
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:09,543
and burned him at the stake.

1619
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:15,470
They would've seen him
as a grotesque monster,

1620
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:18,081
not the sweet lovable boy he is.

1621
01:25:22,647 --> 01:25:25,350
- Yeah, you know, that guy is
clearly, completely unhinged.

1622
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,723
- White people is weird.

1623
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,417
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1624
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:31,568
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at
me, look at me, look at me.

1625
01:25:31,568 --> 01:25:32,401
You ain't got no issue or no beef

1626
01:25:32,401 --> 01:25:35,092
with nobody else in this room but me.

1627
01:25:35,092 --> 01:25:37,889
So why don't you leave all
these people alone and this-

1628
01:25:37,889 --> 01:25:39,509
- You had a chance to go!

1629
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:41,092
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1630
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:42,980
Don't push me, you son of
a bitch. I'll kill you.

1631
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,370
- How's my girl?
- Don't you touch her.

1632
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:47,220
- You'll get your chance to
die, but you won't die first.

1633
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:51,144
That's reserved for Captain
Fish Fucker over here.

1634
01:25:51,144 --> 01:25:53,300
- Hey, now you listen-
- Stop, stop, stop!

1635
01:25:54,338 --> 01:25:55,287
(Isaac gags)

1636
01:25:55,287 --> 01:25:57,560
Captain?
- You see,

1637
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:01,650
you may have been his
father, but I'm his daddy.

1638
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:03,700
- [Isaac] Go to hell, you son of a bitch.

1639
01:26:06,456 --> 01:26:10,382
(Isaac gags and coughs)

1640
01:26:10,382 --> 01:26:11,632
- Get him!
- No.

1641
01:26:14,045 --> 01:26:15,674
- What are you doing? I said kill him!

1642
01:26:15,674 --> 01:26:19,230
(dramatic music)

1643
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,230
- What's wrong, boy?

1644
01:26:21,454 --> 01:26:22,287
After all these years,

1645
01:26:22,287 --> 01:26:25,210
you finally got the case
of the daddy issues?

1646
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:28,323
- Kill him, dammit!
- Yeah, kill me, pussy.

1647
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:30,841
- Listen to me!

1648
01:26:30,841 --> 01:26:34,134
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1649
01:26:34,134 --> 01:26:37,134
Sorry about that. It had to be done.

1650
01:26:39,062 --> 01:26:40,712
You need to listen to your daddy.

1651
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:42,843
- Get him, baby!
- Wait, what?

1652
01:26:42,843 --> 01:26:44,190
- It's kind of a long story,

1653
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,357
but I think we're kind of a thing now.

1654
01:26:46,357 --> 01:26:50,793
(dramatic music)
(Sheriff McDermott grunts)

1655
01:26:50,793 --> 01:26:52,395
(claws slice)
(Sheriff McDermott gags)

1656
01:26:52,395 --> 01:26:55,978
(flesh squelches and rips)

1657
01:27:00,918 --> 01:27:03,650
(Sheriff McDermott gurgles)

1658
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:06,870
- Abby, go on.
- No, captain, we can help.

1659
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:08,220
- The area's too small, confined.

1660
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,720
He'll kill us if we stay here.

1661
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,130
- No, I can't let you die here, captain.

1662
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,693
- No, you can and you will.

1663
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,813
- I think we should listen to him.

1664
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:19,730
- Captain, eat his asshole.
See you on the other side.

1665
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:28,041
(entrails squelch)
(Graveyard Shark growls)

1666
01:27:33,021 --> 01:27:35,438
(body thuds)

1667
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,766
- I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

1668
01:27:38,766 --> 01:27:40,440
I'm sorry you feel lost
and abandoned by me.

1669
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:45,300
I'm sorry I ran away.
That's in the past now, boy.

1670
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:47,850
You might be a big fish in a small pond,

1671
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:49,380
but you never realized, motherfucker,

1672
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:52,520
is I'm a well in a
teardrop, and it ends here,

1673
01:27:53,753 --> 01:27:54,673
and it ends now.

1674
01:27:54,673 --> 01:27:58,153
I gotta do what I should've
did to you five years ago

1675
01:27:58,153 --> 01:28:00,486
and what I did to your mama.

1676
01:28:02,329 --> 01:28:04,809
So I want you to man up,

1677
01:28:04,809 --> 01:28:07,532
and I want you to get your
balls (speaks indistinctly)

1678
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:09,204
in there, and I want you to prepare

1679
01:28:09,204 --> 01:28:11,204
for the biggest epic fight in your life

1680
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:13,410
because what you don't
understand, motherfucker,

1681
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:16,080
is you might be the biggest,
you might be the baddest,

1682
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,260
you might be the strongest,
quite possibly the fastest,

1683
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,820
but I got the upper hand.

1684
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,890
And when you go face to face with me

1685
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:27,030
and the weapon, I, they got my shit.

1686
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:29,508
- Wait, there should be
an exit right up this way.

1687
01:28:29,508 --> 01:28:31,188
- Take this.

1688
01:28:31,188 --> 01:28:33,938
(footsteps thud)

1689
01:28:34,801 --> 01:28:35,634
- Fuck.

1690
01:28:37,387 --> 01:28:39,748
All right, plan B. Sup!

1691
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:44,748
(flesh squelches and rips)
(dramatic music)

1692
01:28:55,052 --> 01:28:57,469
(body thuds)

1693
01:29:02,194 --> 01:29:05,444
(dark brooding music)

1694
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,490
- All right, you guys need to
go, go back to town, get help.

1695
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:13,350
